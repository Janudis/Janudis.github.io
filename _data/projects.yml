  subtitle: "ROS • SLAM & Localization • Real-time Perception"
  description: >
    Built and deployed a full navigation + perception stack on a real three-omni-wheeled robot for
    industrial-style task scenarios. Integrated ROS navigation with gmapping (2D SLAM) and robust
    localization using AMCL and an EKF fusion of laser scans and wheel odometry. Deployed YOLOv4
    for real-time detection of industrial tools and objects. Achieved 4th place in the RoboCup@Work
    competition.

  description: >
    Chatbot assistant that translates a simple natural-language question into actionable agricultural
    insights using Earth observation and open geospatial data. Integrates Google Earth Engine datasets
    (e.g., NDVI, land surface temperature, soil moisture, air quality proxies) and provides an accessible
    interface for non-technical users to monitor conditions and support field decisions.
