- title: "RoboCup@Work — Democritus Industrial Robotics (DIR)"
  subtitle: "ROS • SLAM & Localization • Real-time Perception"
  description: >
    Built and deployed a full navigation + perception stack on a real three-omni-wheeled robot for
    industrial-style task scenarios. Integrated ROS navigation with gmapping (2D SLAM) and robust
    localization using AMCL and an EKF fusion of laser scans and wheel odometry. Deployed YOLOv4
    for real-time detection of industrial tools and objects. Achieved 4th place in the RoboCup@Work
    competition.

  subtitle: "Earth Observation • Google Earth Engine • Decision Support"
  description: >
    Built a chatbot assistant that turns a simple natural-language question into actionable agricultural
    insights using Earth observation and open geospatial data. Integrated Google Earth Engine datasets
    (e.g., vegetation, land surface temperature, soil moisture, air quality proxies) and presented results
    through a farmer-friendly interface. Won 1st place in Greece.

  subtitle: "GIS • RoadRunner • OpenDRIVE • NVIDIA DWMap"
  description: >
    End-to-end pipeline for building HD maps from real-world geospatial sources and converting them into
    simulator/stack-friendly formats. Collected orthophotos and digital elevation models (DEMs) from Greek
    public datasets and processed them in ArcGIS. Authored lane-level HD maps in MathWorks RoadRunner,
    then built Python tooling to convert OpenDRIVE (.xodr/XML) and GeoJSON outputs into NVIDIA DWMap (XML).
    Also created a detailed 3D vehicle model in Blender and imported it into RoadRunner for scenario testing.

- title: "Smart Solar Panel System (Arduino)"
  subtitle: "Mini project — Bachelor Electronics course"
  description: >
    Designed and built a small solar tracking prototype that automatically rotates toward the strongest
    light source. Modeled the mechanical structure in SolidWorks and fabricated parts via 3D printing.
    Implemented the control logic in Arduino IDE (C/C++) using light sensor readings to estimate direction
    and adjust the panel for improved exposure. Includes a full demo and open-source code.
