  subtitle: "ROS • SLAM & Localization • Real-time Perception"
  description: >
    Built and deployed a full navigation + perception stack on a real three-omni-wheeled robot for
    industrial-style task scenarios. Integrated ROS navigation with gmapping (2D SLAM) and robust
    localization using AMCL and an EKF fusion of laser scans and wheel odometry. Deployed YOLOv4
    for real-time detection of industrial tools and objects. Achieved 4th place in the RoboCup@Work
    competition.

  subtitle: "Earth Observation • Geospatial Data • Decision Support"
  description: >
    Prototype for the Space Apps challenge “Leveraging Earth Observation Data for Informed Agricultural
    Decision-Making”. Built a small decision-support workflow that uses Earth observation and open
    geospatial data to help monitor fields and guide agricultural actions in a clear, user-facing way.
