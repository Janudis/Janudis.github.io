  subtitle: "ROS • SLAM & Localization • Real-time Perception"
  description: >
    Built and deployed a full navigation + perception stack on a real three-omni-wheeled robot for
    industrial-style task scenarios. Integrated ROS navigation with gmapping (2D SLAM) and robust
    localization using AMCL and an EKF fusion of laser scans and wheel odometry. Deployed YOLOv4
    for real-time detection of industrial tools and objects. Achieved 4th place in the RoboCup@Work
    competition.
