# Welcome to Jekyll!

# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

 I’m currently pursuing a PhD in Robotics at the [Vision for Robotics Lab (V4RL)](https://v4rl.com/), under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Margarita Chli, in University of Cyprus. 
 My research focuses on useful scene representations for robotic vision perception. 
 As a passionate and self-driven innovation enthusiast, I continuously push to learn new skills and master what I already know.
